# 💬🧬 ChatGSE
Gene set interpretation and more, assisted by large language models. Find the deployed app at https://chatgse.streamlit.app. We are currently ***heavily*** work in progress, but we are commited to open source and very open to comments, criticisms, and contributions! Preprint coming soon.

## 🤝 Get involved!
We are very happy about contributions from the community, large and small!
If you would like to contribute to the platform's development, please refer to
our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). :)

Importantly, you don't need to be an expert on any of the technical aspects of the
project! As long as you are interested and would like to help make this platform
a great open-source tool, you're good. 🙂

If you want to ask informal questions, talk about dev things, or just chat, please join our community at https://biocypher.zulipchat.com!

> **Imposter syndrome disclaimer:** We want your help. No, really. There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not ready, that you aren't skilled enough to contribute. We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong. Most importantly, there are many valuable ways to contribute besides writing code.
